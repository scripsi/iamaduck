# This is the I am a Duck configuration file
#
# Lines beginning with "#"" are comments and have
# no effect. Before each setting, there is usually
# a comment to tell you what it does and how to
# change it. Where I say "uncomment the next line"
# that means to delete the # symbol from the next 
# line so that it comes into effect!
